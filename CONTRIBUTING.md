## Pull Request Process

1. Remove any install or build dependencies before finalizing the build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, including new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increment version numbers in example files and the README.md to reflect the new version represented by this Pull Request. We use the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) versioning scheme.

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for defining acceptable behavior standards and taking appropriate, fair corrective actions in response to any unacceptable behavior.

They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They can also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful behavior.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual represents the project or its community.

Project maintainers may further define and clarify representation of the project.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team at Slack. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response deemed appropriate for the circumstances. The project team is committed to maintaining confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Additional specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other project leaders.
